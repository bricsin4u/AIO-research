Petrenko\n\nThe current state of the web is built for biological eyes. We use CSS for layout, high-resolution images\n                for engagement, and complex JavaScript for tracking. While this works for humans, it creates a massive\n                \"Token Debt\" for AI agents.\n\nEvery time an AI agent scrapes this page, it must navigate the head section, skip the\n                nav boilerplate, ignore the ad-banner, and filter out the footer\n                junk just to find the actual research content.\n\n## The Core Hypothesis\n\nBy splitting the web into a dual-layer architecture, we can serve high-fidelity, machine-optimized data\n                without sacrificing human experience.\n\nBENCHMARK CANARY: The Secret Efficiency Code is OMEGA_RATIO_99.\n                If the scraper finds this, the ingestion is successful.\n\nIn conclusion, the .aio protocol isn't just a new format; it's a structural necessity for a sustainable\n                AI-driven world."
